   <h1>Hell Raiders</h1>
   <h2>Introduction</h2>
   <p><strong>Hell Raiders</strong> was created as a collaborative project with my fellow classmates as part of our coursework. We were inspired by the simplicity and charm of Vampire Survivors, and aimed to capture that same indie spirit while adding our own unique twist to the gameplay. </p>

   <p>In <strong>Hell Raiders</strong>, you play as a lone crusader who has been cast into the depths of hell, where survival is your only goal. The game features a top-down view, with fast-paced gameplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat. As you progress, you'll encounter increasingly difficult enemies, each with unique behaviors and attack patterns. Your goal is to survive as long as possible, taking down as many enemies as you can before they overwhelm you.</p>
